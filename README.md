# Homepage

My goal for this project is to expand the `Homepage` project from Week 8 into a fully-fledged web app. I have made a couple of games in Python prior to enrolling in cs50 and I want to be able to port those games to the web and make them accessible from my homepage.

Games are what first drew me to programming, when I started getting better at programming I got inspired to implement my own version of Minesweeper, as well as the card games Cribbage and 31. While the Minesweeper I built was implemented using a GUI, the card games were based in the terminal. I appreciate the retro aesthetic of the terminal but when I wanted to share these games with my friends I realized there was no good way to do that without connecting them to the internet and making a GUI that is more accessible than a terminal.

I first want to implement Minesweeper which will be relatively simple as it is single player. Then I also want to implement the card games complete with GUIs which will probably be implemented in HTML and javascript. I also want the card games to have multiplayer support.
